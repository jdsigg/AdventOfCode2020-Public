Logic

- Read the file into memory
- Start with pointers at index 0 and 24, while having one at index 25 to search
- Search sum combinations with a nested for loop for the desired number outside the range
- If one is found, that is the answer. If not, repeat the process by incrementing all 3 pointers

Runtime analysis will come after I re-factor.
